# Data Visualization Projects

## I like to express my creativity and imagination. Data is practically everywhere and it's great to look at data in a fun and creative way.

Bicycle-Racing-Scatter-Plot: Scatter plot that shows the top speeds for biking up the Alpe d'Huez. Includes if the cyclist doped.

Choropleth-Map: A cool map a shows the U.S. counties.

GDP-Bar-Chart: A bar chart that shows the United States Gross Domestic Product. There are tooltips, but the first one takes a few seconds to pop up.

Surface-Temperature-Heat-Map: A nice looking heat map that shows the surface ground temperature.

Video-Game-Tree-Map: A very strange-looking (unique?) tree map containing the top video games.
