# My Certificates!

I started coding on July 28th, 2021 with Free Code Camp! My certificates for those will be in this file. Although they are not good, the projects for FCC are stored on CodePen: https://codepen.io/icantfindmyspider. The projects I have on my GitHub are much better; CodePen is used to submit my projects for FCC.
