# My Certificates!

I started coding on July 28th, 2021 with Free Code Camp! My certificates for those will be in this file. The projects for FCC are stored in CodePen: https://codepen.io/icantfindmyspider. Although they are not good. The projects I have on my GitHub are much better. I only use CodePen to submit my projects for FCC.
