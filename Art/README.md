# Art Projects 

## I think art is a nice way to express things nonverbally. I picked up Blender during 2022, it's extremely fun!

Blender: 3D modelling projects.

Frisk-and-Toriel: Created to celebrate Deltarune Chapter 2. Although Frisk is not in Deltarune, I thought it was close enough. View it here: https://replit.com/@LeonTrii/Frisk-and-Toriel#index.html

Kirby-animation: Waving Kirby with a beating heart on his left hand. View it here: https://truongmleon.github.io/

Mole: A mole for my Whack-A-Mole game: https://github.com/truongmleon/Playground/tree/main/Games/Whack-A-Mole
