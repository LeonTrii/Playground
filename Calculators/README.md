# Calculator Projects

## Math and science are my favorite subjects. Using math and computers to calculate things quickly is quite helpful and cool.

Banking: A small program that can deposit and withdraw money. Has a few other features.

Calculator: A simple calculator that does arithmetic.

Chemistry-Conversions: A chemistry conversion program to help convert energy units and the temperature. I created this for my chemistry class to avoid googling extensively to check my answers. While the results aren't 100 percent accurate, it is good enough to check my answers.

Interest: An interest calculator.

Significant-Figures: Calculator for counting significant figures in large numbers.

Mean_Var_Std: Calculates the mean, variance, and standard deviation from an array.
