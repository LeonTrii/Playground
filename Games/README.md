# Game Projects

## I really enjoyed playing games. Games in which you explore or problem solve likely played a role in my passion for programming.

Connect-four: A connect four game for two players. It doesn't have AI unfortunately.

Tic-Tac-Toe: Classic Tic-Tac-Tow game for two players.

Unbeatable-Pong-Game: Retro Pong Game with unbeatable AI. Also, the first project of this year!

Whack-a-mole: Simple Whack-a-mole game. myMole.png is from mole.html. I used CSS to add color to the mole.
