# AP Computer Science A FRQs 2016-2019, 2021

I decided to challenge myself by taking a few available FRQs. This will also help me practice for the AP Computer Science A exam. And, it's just very fun! Sometimes Collegeboard will not show the implementation for code, so I have to create my own to test my code. I did not do questions involving interfaces and abstract classes.
