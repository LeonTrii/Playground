# The stuff I did during high school

## Project count: 70

The first 13~ months of learning how to code was a great start. I enjoyed programming and all of the stuff I could learn. There is so much more to learn and I love seeing my progress. Starting now, I will start creating more sophisticated projects. 08/15/2022.
