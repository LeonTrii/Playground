# First 13 months

## Project count: 60

The first 13~ months of learning how to code was a great start. I enjoyed programming and all of the stuff I could learn. There is so much more to learn and I love seeing my progress. I learned mostly web development with React.js and a little bit of data science with Python. Had my first formal programming course at high school and succeeded. Starting now, I will start creating more sophisticated projects. 08/15/2022.
