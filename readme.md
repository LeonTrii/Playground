# The stuff I did during high school

Hello, I started learning how to code on July 3rd, 2021. The aspect of problem solving makes it very enjoyable.

I graduated from high school on June 8th, 2024, so I'll not be updating this repo anymore. It's only been about three years; I'm happy with my progress.

## Vue.js

My favorite thing about Vue are the for loops.

Run:
```
npm install
npm run serve
```
## React.js 

Run:
```
npm install
npm run dev
```
