# The stuff I did during high school

Hello, I started learning how to code on July 3rd, 2021.

I graduated from high school on June 8th, 2024, so I'll not be updating this repo anymore. It's only been about three years. Some of the code here is REALLY bad, but it's nice to see the progress.

## Vue.js

My favorite thing about Vue are the for loops.

Run:
```
npm install
npm run serve
```
## React.js 

Run:
```
npm install
npm run dev
```
