# Small projects
Small projects that I've completed :D

Frisk-and-Toriel: Created to celebrate Deltarune Chapter 2. Although Frisk is not from Deltarune, I thought it was close enough.

Kirby-animation: waving Kirby with a beating heart on his left hand.

Product-landing-page: a made up website with fake products about finding spiders. (Will update)

Survey-form: a Rick Roll YouTube link upon submitting the form.
