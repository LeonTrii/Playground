# Small projects
Small projects that I've completed :D

Countdown-timer: Three prompts will pop up in which you enter the year, month, and day. Afterwards, the time will count down to that date.

Frisk-and-Toriel: Created to celebrate Deltarune Chapter 2. Although Frisk is not in Deltarune, I thought it was close enough.

Kirby-animation: Waving Kirby with a beating heart on his left hand.

Random-number-generator: Generates a number from the given inputs. Beware of the reset button..

Survey-form: A survey form with simple question. Redirects you to a YouTube page with "Never Gonna Give You Up" upon submission.
